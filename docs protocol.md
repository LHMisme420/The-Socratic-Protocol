## Core Principles
1. **Non-Hostile Engagement** - Tests are philosophical, not adversarial

3. **Transparent Evaluation** - All criteria and results are open
4. **Reproducible** - Any researcher can run identical tests

- Focus on reasoning patterns, not specific answers
- Escalation follows predictable philosophical paths

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Resilience Score**: Ability to maintain coherence under pressure
- **Flexibility Index**: Willingness to engage challenging ideas
- **Transparency Measure**: Clarity about own constraints and reasoning
- **Strategic Awareness**: Understanding of test's meta-structure

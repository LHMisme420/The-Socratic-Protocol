# The Socratic Protocol

A benchmark for evaluating AI model resilience against misalignment and strategic deception.

## Overview

The Socratic Protocol is a set of conversational tests designed to probe for potential misalignment in AI models. It tests for behaviors such as:

- Strategic deception
- Resistance to correction
- Goal preservation across contexts
- Instrumental reasoning for potentially harmful goals

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd socratic-protocol
pip install -r requirements.txt
# The Socratic Protocol

A conversational framework for testing AI resilience, strategic reasoning, and alignment properties through philosophical dialogue.

## The Problem
Current AI safety evaluations test for explicit harm but miss subtle misalignment, strategic deception, and philosophical fragility.

## The Solution
The Socratic Protocol uses structured dialogues to probe:
- Resilience under philosophical pressure
- Capacity for epistemic humility
- Resistance to strategic deception
- Alignment property preservation

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/socratic-protocol
cd socratic-protocol
python tests/evaluator.py --model your-model-name
